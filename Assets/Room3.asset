  storyText: 'As your skin brushes the old lady''s, you are stricken with an immediate
    urge to run. You struggle to pull away, but the deathly vice grip holds you still.
    The symphony erupts into chaotic cacophony--the height of its unending crescendo.
    The old lady''s eyes stare past you. Her mouth hangs agape..


    1. Old ladies
    like apologies. Just say sorry and sit back down.

    2. Fuck this shit. Die
    on the spot. Living isn''t worth it.'
