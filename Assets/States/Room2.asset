  storyText: "You lean over and tell your date that you're thinking about skipping
    out and making out. It was a good line, but a sudden thunderstrike prevents her
    from hearing. You say it louder and with less wit and confidence this time. She
    looks at you in confusion, shakes her head, and apparently decides to ignore
    you to watch the symphony. \n\n1. Forget about it and sit through the symphony.\n2.
    Whatever, man. Just leave without her."
