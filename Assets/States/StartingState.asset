  storyText: 'The symphony rages with discord. A great storm pounds with wind and
    rain against the old cathedral. You sit next to your date, the one who suggested
    this, and she seems to enjoy it. You sit in the first row in the leftmost seats.
    An old lady sitting to your right looks as if she died at the cresendo. Smells
    like it, too. What to do..



    1. Leave without your date

    2. Leave with
    your date

    3. Keep watching the symphony'
